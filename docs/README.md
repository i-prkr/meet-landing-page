## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- BEM
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It has been good to continue becoming familiar with Sass and BEM, and consolidating responsive design techniques recently learned. A small technique learned was placing content over images, as seen in the footer of the design. I also took the opportunity to become more deeply familiar with flexbox, in particular the `flex: 1` shorthand, and exactly how it changes the properties of `flex-grow, flex-shrink` and `flex-basis` and how they operate.

### Useful resources

- [DigitalOcean CSS background images opacity tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-change-a-css-background-images-opacity) - This helped me better understand working with content over images.
- [CSS Tricks Flexbox article by Kevin Powell](https://css-tricks.com/equal-columns-with-flexbox-its-more-complicated-than-you-might-think/) - great article looking deeply at how flex box columns are calculated.
